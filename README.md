# Szakatsa.Result

Szakatsa.Result is a lightweight, extensible C# library that provides a robust implementation of the Result pattern. It‚Äôs designed to encapsulate success and failure outcomes in a clean, expressive, and type-safe manner.



## Features

- Represent results with or without values
- Support for strongly-typed errors
- Multiple exceptions  per failure
- Minimal, dependency-free API
- Public domain licensing (Unlicense)


## Usage

### Basic Result (No Value)
    using Szakatsa.Result;

    Result successful = Result.Success();
    Result failed = Result.Fail(new NotImplementedException());

### Result With Value
    using Szakatsa.Result;

    Result<string> successfulWithValue = Result.Success("This is the value of the successful attempt");
    Result<string> failedWithValue = Result.Fail(new NotSupportedException("There is no value associated when an attempt fails"));


### Result with Value and typed Error
    Result<string, int> failedWithTypedError = Result.Fail(32); //e.g., an error code

### Checking Result State
    using Szakatsa.Result;

    Result<string, int> result = Result.Fail(64);

    if (result.IsSuccessful)
    {
        string value = result.Value;
    }
    else
    {
        int errorCode = result.Error;
        Exception[] exceptions = result.Exceptions;
        Exception? combinedException = result.Exception;
    }

The Exception property contains:
- null if no exceptions were registered
- A single exception if only one was registered
- An AggregateException if multiple exceptions were registered
